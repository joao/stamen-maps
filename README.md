# Stamen Maps with easing, for touch interfaces
A version of [Stamen Maps](http://maps.stamen.com) with easing support, ideal for touch interfaces.  
Built on [Modest Maps](http://modestmaps.com) and the [easey](http://mapbox.com/easey) library.

_insert design justification for why easing is greate for interacting with a map_   
Works great on an iPad/tablets.
